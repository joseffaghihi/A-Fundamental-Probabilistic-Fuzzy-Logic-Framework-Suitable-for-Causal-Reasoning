For instance, $T$ could be a type of medical treatment and $Y$ be the outcome of $T$. Indeed, $Y=1$ when the treatment is successful and otherwise $Y=0$. We also denote the potential outcome corresponding to $T=t$ by $Y(t)$. A significant way to measure the causal effect of $T$ on $Y$ is to see the difference between the outcomes when $T$  is $high$ and when $T$ is $low$. We might be also interested in $medium$ treatments.  Thus, we assume that $low$, $medium$ and $high$ are fuzzy attributes of $T$, and then we use our PFL theory. Given a statistical population, we define:\n",

However, it is not possible to measure all potential outcomes for a unit simultaneously.  Hence, for a period of time, only one of the above potential outcomes could be measured for a unit, and the other ones remain missing.
